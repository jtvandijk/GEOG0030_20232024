You will most likely encounter many error messages, experience software crashes, and spend hours to identify bugs in your code. However, the rewards of learning how to programmatically solve complex spatial problems will be very much worth it in the end.\nIf you need specific assistance with this course please:\n\nAsk a question at the end of a lecture or during the computer practical.\nCheck the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to this module’s assessment.\nAttend the Department’s Coding Therapy sessions that are run on a weekly basis.\nAttend the scheduled Geocomputation Additional Support Hours.\n\nIf after pursuing all these avenues you still need help, you can book a slot in our Academic Support and Feedback hours. You can use this time to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material, assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module."

    "title": "1  Geocomputation: An Introduction",
    "section": "1.4 Software",
    "text": "1.4 Software\nThis module primarily uses the R programming language, although we start by using QGIS in the next two weeks to give you a basic foundation in the principles of spatial analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow the instructions below to install both R and QGIS onto your own personal computer. If you cannot install the software on your personal computer or you are not planning to bring your own laptop to the computer practicals, please refer to the UCL Desktop and RStudio Server section below. Please make sure that you have access to a working installation of QGIS and R (including relevant packages) before the first hands-on practical session next week.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1 QGIS Installation\nQGIS is an open-source graphic user interface GIS with many community developed add-on packages (or plugins) that provide additional functionality to the software. You can download and install QGIS on your personal machine by going to the QGIS website: [Link].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend installing the Long Term Release (QGIS 3.28 LTR) as this version should be the most stable version. For Windows users: be aware that the QGIS installation can be a little slow.\n\n\n\nAfter installation, start QGIS to see if the installation was successful.\n\n\n1.4.2 R and RStudio Installation\nR is both a programming language and software environment - in the form of RStudio - originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. R’s great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system, and is free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a very large user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical, and importantly for us, geographical tasks.\nInstalling R takes a few relatively simple steps involving two programmes. First there is the R programme itself. Follow these steps to get it installed on your computer:\n\nNavigate in your browser to your nearest CRAN mirror: [Link]\nIf you use a Windows computer, click on Download R for Windows. Then click on base. Download and install R 4.3.x for Windows. If you use a Mac computer, click on Download R for macOS and download and install R-4.3.x.arm64.pkg for Apple silicon Macs and R-4.3.x.x86_64.pkg for older Intal Macs.\n\nThat is it! You now have installed the latest version of R on your own machine. However, to make working with R a little bit easier we also need to install something called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We will use RStudio:\n\nNavigate to the official webpage of RStudio: [Link]\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop on your computer (free version!)\n\nAfter this, start RStudio to see if the installation was successful and no errors are shown after start up.\n\n\n1.4.3 UCL Desktop and RStudio Server\nAs an alternative to installing QGIS and R with RStudio onto your personal device, there are some other options. Firstly, both programmes are available through Desktop@UCL Anywhere as well as all UCL computers on campus. In case of R, there is also an RStudio server version available which you can access through your web browser: [Link]\nYou should be able to log in with your normal UCL username and password. After logging in, you should see the RStudio interface appear.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The RStudio Server interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is the first time you log on to RStudio server you may only see the RStudio interface appear once you have clicked on the start a new session button. More importantly: if you are not on campus, RStudio server will only work with an active Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection that links your personal computer into UCL’s network. Details on setting up a VPN connection can be found in UCL’s VPN connection guides: [Link]\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 R package installation\nNow we have installed or have access to QGIS and R, we need to customise R. Many useful R function come in packages, these are free libraries of code written and made available by other by R users. This includes packages specifically developed for data cleaning, data wrangling, visualisation, mapping, and spatial analysis. To save us some time, we will install all R packages that we will need over the next ten weeks in one go. Now copy and paste the following code into the console window. You can execute the code by hitting Enter. This may take a while.\n\n# install packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"sf\", \"tmap\", \"terra\", \"dodgr\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you have used R or RStudio Server before and already installed some of the packages in the above list, do re-install all packages by running the code above to make sure you have the latest versions. Legacy installations that have not been updated may lay lead to problems when going through the tutorials.\n\n\n\nOnce you have installed the packages, we need to check whether we can in fact load them into our R session. Copy and paste the following code into the console, and execute by hitting Enter again.\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(dodgr)\n\nYou will see some information printed to your console but as long as you do not get a message that is similar to Error: package or namespace load failed for &lt;packagename&gt; or Error: package '&lt;packagename' could not be loaded all should be fine.\n\n\n1.4.5 A note on ArcGIS\nArcGIS Pro is the main commercial GIS software that you may have already used or seen/heard about through other modules or even job adverts. We do not use ArcGIS Pro in our Practicals for several reasons:\n\nComputing requirements for ArcGIS Pro are substantial and it only operates on the Windows Operating System. For Mac or Linux users, using ArcGIS Pro would require using either a Virtual Machine, Docker Installation, or running a copy of Windows OS on a separate partition of your hard drive.\nArcGIS is proprietary software, which means you need a license to use the software. For those of us in education, the University covers the cost of this license, but when you leave, you will need to pay for a personal license to continue using the software and repeat any analysis you have used the software for.\nWhilst ArcPro can use pure Python (and even R) as a programming language within it through scripts and notebooks, it primarily relies on its own ArcPy and ArcGIS API for Python packages to run the in-built tools and analytical functions. To use these packages, you still need a license which makes it difficult to share your code with others if they do not have their own ArcGIS license.\n\nRecent developments in the ArcPro software, however, does make it an attractive tool for spatial data science and quantitative geography: it has cross-user functionality, from data analysts who like to use a tool called Notebooks for their code development, to those focused more on cartography and visualisation with in-built bridges to Adobe’s Creative Suite. We therefore do not want to put you off looking into ArcGIS in the future, but for this course, we want to ensure the reproducibility of your work."

    "section": "2.4 Population change in London",
    "text": "2.4 Population change in London\nThe second part of this practical will introduces you to attribute joins followed by creating a choropleth map. You will be using different types of joins throughout this module, and probably the rest of your career, so it is incredibly important that you understand how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe datasets you will create in this practical will be used in next week’s practical, so make sure to follow every step and save your data carefully.\n\n\n\nWhen using spatial data, there is generally a very specific workflow that you will need to go through and, believe it or not, the majority of this is not actually focused on analysing your data. One of the most often-quoted GIS-related unreferenced ‘fact’ is that anyone working with spatial data will spend 80% of their time simply finding, retrieving, managing and processing the data before any analysis can be done.\nOne of the reasons behind this need for a substantial amount of processing is that the data you often need to use is almost never in the format that you require for analysis. For example, for our investigation, there is not a ‘ready-made’ spatial population dataset (i.e. population shapefile) we can download to explore population change across England:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A quick Google search shows that finding a shapefile of England’s population is not straightforward.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, we need to go and find the raw datasets and create the data layers that we want. As a result, before beginning any spatial analysis project, it is best-practice to think through what end product you will ultimately need for your analysis.\nA typical spatial analysis workflow usually looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nAction\n\n\n\n\nidentify\nThink about the data you need to complete your analysis.\n\n\nfind\nFind the data that matches your requirements.\n\n\ndownload\nStore the data on your computer in the right folder.\n\n\nclean\nAssess whether the data needs pre-processing before moving to QGIS or R.\n\n\nload\nLoad the cleaned data into QGIS, R, or software of choice.\n\n\nprocess\nPrepare the data so that they are ready for analysis (e.g. joining, aggregating).\n\n\nanalyse\nExecute the actual analysis that you set out to do.\n\n\nvisualise\nCreate graphs and maps where appropriate.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the analysis and visualisation parts only make up the last steps of the workflow and instead, the workflow is very top-heavy with data management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery often in GIS-related courses you will be given pre-processed datasets. Because data management is an essential part of your workflow, we will clean (the majority of) our data from the get-go. This will help you understand the processes that you will need to go through in the future as you search for and download your own data as well as deal with the data first-hand before loading it into our GIS software.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Setting the scene\nIn this part of the practical, we will investigate how the population in London has changed over time. Understanding population change - over time and space - is spatial analysis at its most fundamental. We can understand a lot just from where population is growing or decreasing, including thinking through the impacts of these changes on the provision of housing, education, health and transport infrastructure.\nWe can also see first-hand the impact of wider socio-economic processes, such as urbanisation. Today we will look at population in London in the Census years of 2011 and 2021 at the Lower Super Output Area scale that we can use within our future analysis projects, starting next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the population dataset to normalise other datasets. Why? When we record events created by humans, there is often a population bias: simply, more people in an area will by probability lead to a higher occurrence of said event, such as crime. We will look at this in greater detail next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Finding data\nIn the UK, finding authoritative data on population and Administrative Geography boundaries is increasingly straight-forward. Over the last decade, the UK government has opened up many of its datasets as part of an Open Data precedent that began in 2010 with the creation of data.gov.uk and the Open Government Licence (the terms and conditions for using data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData.gov.uk is the UK government’s central database that contains open data that the central government, local authorities and public bodies publish. This includes, for example, aggregated census and health data – and even government spending. In addition to this central database, there are other authoritative databases run by the government and/or respective public bodies that contain either a specific type of data (e.g. census data, crime data) or a specific collection of datasets (e.g. health data from the NHS, data about London). Some portals are less up-to-date than others, so it is wise to double-check with the ‘originators’ of the data to see if there are more recent versions.\n\n\n\nFor our practical, we will access data from two portals:\n\nFor our administrative boundaries, we will download the spatial data from the Open Geography Portal.\nFor our population data, we will download attribute data directly from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Housekeeping\nBefore we download our data, it is important to establish an organised file systems that we will use throughout the modul. Create a GEOG0030 folder in your Documents folder on your computer and within your GEOG0030 folder, create the following subfolders:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolder name\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nraw\nTo store all your raw data files that have not yet been cleaned and processed.\n\n\ndata\nTo store data files that have been cleaned and processed.\n\n\noutput\nTo store all your final output data files and maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Downloading spatial data\nWe will start by downloading the administrative geography boundaries for England and Wales:\n\nNavigate to the Open Geography Portal: [Link]\nIn the main menu go to Boundaries -&gt; Census Boundaries  -&gt; Lower Layer Super Output Areas -&gt; 2011 Boundaries.\nClick on LSOA (Dec 2011) Boundaries Super Generalised Clipped (BSC) EW V4.\nClick on Download -&gt; Download GeoPackage.\n\nRepeat the above process to also download the 2021 LSOA boundaries: Lower Layer Super Output Areas (2021) Boundaries EW BSC. Make sure you download the Super generalised (200m) version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative geographies are a way of dividing the country into smaller sub-divisions or areas that correspond with the area of responsibility of local authorities and government bodies. These administrative sub-divisions and their associated geography have several important uses, including assigning electoral constituencies and serving as a mechanism for collecting census data. These geographies are updated as populations evolve and as a result the boundaries of the administrative geographies are subject to either periodic or occasional change. This is why we need to download both 2011 and 2021 boundaries. More details on the administrative geographies of the UK can be found on the website of the Office for National Statistics.\n\n\n\nNow open your GEOG0030/data/raw/ folder and create a new folder called boundaries. Rename the two files you just downloaded to LSOA2011.gpkg and LSOA2021.gpkg, respectively, and copy these into your boundaries folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have used spatial data before and noticed that we did not download a collection of files knowns as a shapefile but a geopackage instead. Whilst shapefiles are still being used, and you will most likely come across them at some point in your career, the more modern, more portable, and open-source geopackage should be your spatial data format of choice where possible. Have a look at this article on towardsdatascience.com for an excellent explanation on why one should use geopackage files instead of shapefiles: [Link]\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Downloading population data\nFor our population data, we will use the 2011 and 2021 Census population counts that are made available by the ONS through Nomis.\n\nNavigate to the Nomis portal: [Link]\nIn the main menu go to Census -&gt; 2011 Census -&gt; Lower Layer Super Output Areas -&gt; 2011 Boundaries.\nClick on Key Statistics.\nClick on KS101EW - Usual resident population.\nClick on Query data on the left-hand side of the window.\nSelect Geography and set 2011 super output areas - lower layer to All.\nClick on Download data.\nOnce the data is ready for download, download the file to your computer.\n\nTo get the 2011 Census population counts, you should:\n\nIn the main menu go to Census -&gt; 2011 Census -&gt; Lower Layer Super Output Areas -&gt; 2021 Boundaries.\nClick on Topic Summaries.\nClick on TS007A - Age by five-year age bands.\nClick on Query data on the left-hand side of the window.\nSelect Geography and set 2021 super output areas - lower layer to All.\n\nClick on Download data.\nOnce the data is ready for download, download the file to your computer.\n\nIn your GEOG0030/data/raw/ folder, now create a new folder called population and copy the two spreadsheets to the newly created population folder. Rename the files you downloaded to: LSOA2011_population.xlsx and LSOA2021_population.xlsx, respectively.\n\n\n2.4.6 Cleaning data\nWhen you open up any of the LSOA spreadsheets in Excel, you will notice that some additional information is contained at the top of each of the files. This extra information will confuse QGIS and we therefore need to do a bit of data cleaning. We will also save the data in csv format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncsv stands for comma (or character) separated values. A csv file can be thought of as stripped-down Excel spreadsheet in which every column of data is separated by a comma. If you open a csv file within Excel, however, it will look “normal”. The advantage of using csv files is that it (should) make it easier to read data into QGIS and R as less things can go wrong."
