<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Analysing Spatial Patterns II: Point Pattern Analysis</h1>
<p>This week, we will be looking at Point Pattern Analysis. With point pattern analysis, we look to detect clusters or patterns across a set of points, including measuring density, dispersion and homogeneity in our point structures. There are several approaches to calculating and detecting these clusters and today we explore several of these techniques using our <a href="06-operations.html#bike-theft-w06">bike theft dataset from last week</a>.</p>

<p>This week, we again investigate bike theft in London in 2021 as we continue to look to confirm our very simple hypothesis: <em>that bike theft cluster in space.</em> This week, instead of looking at the distance of individual bike thefts from train stations, we will look to analyse the distribution of clusters and identify hotspots of bike theft.</p>

<p>All of the geometric operations and spatial queries we will use are contained within the <code>sf</code> library. For our Point Pattern Analysis, we will be using the <code>spatstat</code> library (“spatial statistics”). The <code>spatstat</code> library contains the different Point Pattern Analysis techniques we will want to use in this practical. We will also need the <code>terra</code> library, which provides classes and functions to manipulate geographic (spatial) data in raster format. We will use this package briefly today, but look into it in more detail in <a href="09-raster.html">Week 9</a>. Lastly, you will also need to load the <code>dbscan</code> package. Now let us add all of the libraries we will be using today to the top of our script:</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="point-pattern-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Point pattern analysis</h2>
<p>Point pattern analysis (PPA) studies the spatial distribution of points. PPA uses the <strong>density</strong>, <strong>dispersion</strong> and <strong>homogeneity</strong> in our point datasets to assess, quantify and characterise its distribution. Over the last fifty years, various methods and measurements have been developed to analyze, model, visualise, and interpret these properties of point patterns (<a href="https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/point-pattern-analysis">Qiang et al, 2020</a>).</p>
<p>There are three main categories of PPA techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>: The use of descriptive statistics will provide a summary of the basic characteristics of a point pattern, such as its central tendency and dispersion. Descriptive statistics provide a simple way of visualising a dataset as a whole, from plotting the median or mean centre, or, often preferably, a standard deviational ellipse for those datasets that display a directional pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Density-based methods</strong>: Density-based methods focus on the <em>first-order</em> properties of a dataset, i.e.&nbsp;the variation in the individual locations of the points in the dataset across the area of interest, and will characterise our dataset’s distribution accordingly in terms of density.</li>
<li><strong>Distanced-based methods</strong>: Distanced-based methods focus on the <em>second-order</em> properties of a dataset, i.e.&nbsp;the interactions between points within our data and whether they appear to have influence on one another and form clusters, and will characterise our dataset’s distribution accordingly in terms of dispersion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main library to use when it comes to point pattern analysis in R is the <code>spatstat</code> library, developed by Baddeley, Rubak and Turner since 2005. As their documentation states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<em>Spatstat is a package for the statistical analysis of spatial data. Its main focus is the analysis of spatial patterns of points in two-dimensional space</em>”.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="{callout-note}">
<p>According to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/vignettes/getstart.pdf">Get Started with <code>spatstat</code> documentation</a> <code>spatstat</code> supports a very wide range of popular techniques for statistical analysis for spatial point patterns, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel estimation of density/intensity<br>
</li>
<li>Quadrat counting and clustering indices</li>
<li>Detection of clustering using Ripley’s K-function</li>
<li>Model-fitting</li>
<li>Monte Carlo tests</li>
</ul>
<p>We will only cover a small amount of the functionality the package offers - it has almost 1,800 pages of documentation and over 1,000 functions, so it would be near impossible to cover everything even if we had a full module dedicated just to PPA.</p>
</div>
<p>Before we get started with our analysis, you need to know one critical piece of information in order to use <code>spatstat</code>: we need our data to be in the format of a <code>ppp</code> object. There are some spatial packages in R that require us to convert our data from an <code>sf</code> simple features object (e.g.&nbsp;for point data, a SpatialPoints object) into a different spatial object class. <code>spatstat</code> is one of them.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>The <code>ppp</code> format is specific to <code>spatstat</code>, but you may find it used in other spatial libraries. An object of the class <code>ppp</code> represents a two-dimensional point dataset within a pre-defined area, known as the <strong>window of observation</strong>, a class in its own right, known as <code>owin</code> in <code>spatstat</code>. We can either directly create a <code>ppp</code> object from a list of coordinates (as long as they are supplied with a window of observation) <strong>or</strong> convert from another data type.</p>

<p>Our plot shows us our <code>bike_theft_ppp</code> object, which includes both the coordinate points of our bike theft data and our observation window. You should also see your <code>bike_theft_ppp</code> object variable appear in your <strong>Environment</strong> window. You should also see a message stating that our data contains duplicated points.</p>
<p>One of the <strong>key assumptions</strong> underlying many analytical methods is that <strong>all events are unique</strong>. In fact, some statistical procedures actually may return very wrong results if duplicate points are found within the data. In terms of our bike theft data, it is likely that it contains duplicates. The Police service use <a href="https://data.police.uk/about/#anonymisation">snapping points</a>, to which crimes are snapped to in order to preserve the anonymity and privacy of those involved. This is an issue in spatial point pattern analysis as we need our <code>events</code>, i.e.&nbsp;each record of a theft and its respective location, to <strong>be unique</strong> in order for our analysis to be accurate. Let’s investigate by how many duplicated points we have:</p>

<p>We clearly have a large number of duplicated points. To account for these issues within our dataset, we have three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We can remove the duplicates and pretend they simply are not there. However, this is feasible only when your research problem allows for this, i.e.&nbsp;the number of points at each location is not as important as the locations themselves or the number of duplicated points is incredibly small and will not affect any analysis.</li>
<li>Create and assign a weighting schema to our points, where each point will have an attribute that details the number of events that occur in that location and utilise this weight within our PPA techniques. Weights, however, can only be used with certain PPA techniques.</li>
<li>Force all points to be unique by utilising a function that offsets our points randomly from their current location. If the <strong>precise</strong> location is not important for your analysis or, for example, you are dealing with data that in our case is already slightly offset, we can introduce a “jitter” to our dataset that slightly adjusts all coordinates so that the event locations do not exactly coincide anymore.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each approach will have a specific compromise, which you will have to decide upon depending on the type of analysis you are completing. In our case, we will choose the jitter approach to keep all of our bike theft events. We know that already the location of our bike thefts are not precise locations of the original theft, therefore adding minimal (~5 metres) additional offset will not affect our analysis.</p>

<p>Density-based techniques are used to characterise the pattern of a point dataset utilising its general distribution. We can calculate densities at both the <strong>global</strong> and <strong>local</strong> scale. However, global densities do not tell us much about the distribution of our data. This is where local density techniques such as <strong>Quadrat Analysis</strong> and <strong>Kernel Density Estimation</strong> can help us.</p>

<p>We can see that we have a global density of ~13 bike thefts per square kilometre. This simple density analysis could be supported with further descriptive statistics, however, we still would know little about the local density of our points. The most basic approach to understanding a point layer’s local density is to simply measure the density at different locations within the study area. This approach helps us assess if the density is constant across the study area. The simplest approach to this measurement is through <strong>Quadrat Analysis</strong>, where the study area is divided into sub-regions. The point density is then computed for each quadrat, by dividing the number of points in each quadrat by the quadrat’s area.</p>

<p>Our resulting quadrat count shows total counts of bike theft. We can see quite quickly that the quadrats in central London are likely to have a higher local density as their count is much higher than those on the outskirts of London. If we divided our count by the area covered by each quadrat, we would also be able to calculate a precise local density. We will not do this for now, as realistically quadrat analysis is not used very often. The reason why we look at this technique is that it provides us with an easy way to think about how to compare our data distribution and how this relates to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a> of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR).</p>

<p>When looking at the distribution of our points and the respective patterns they show, the key question we often want to answer as geographers is: are our points clustered, randomly distributed, uniform or dispersed? Whilst we can visually assess this distribution, to be able to statistically quantify our data’s distribution, we can compare its distribution to that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>. The Poisson distribution describes the probability or rate of an event happening over a fixed interval of time or space.</p>
<p>The Poisson Distribution can be used when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The events are discrete and can be counted in integers</li>
<li>Events are independent of one another</li>
<li>The average number of events over space or time is known</li>
</ul>
<p>Point data that contains a random distribution of points is said to follow a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is very useful as it allows us to compare a random expected model to our observations. Essentially, if our data’s distribution does not fit the Poisson distribution, then we can infer that something interesting might be going on and our events might not actually be independent of each other. Instead, they might be clustered or dispersed and there is likely to be underlying processes influencing these patterns.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can use a Poisson distribution to generate a randomly generated point pattern dataset with the same number of points and the same observation window. We then can compare our quadrat analysis with the theorethical quadrat analysis using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test">chi-squared test</a>, with the null hypotheses that our point data are randomly distributed.</p>

<p>We now have a basic confirmation that our data is not randomly distributed. Instead of looking at the distribution of our bike theft with the boundaries of our quadrats, we can analyse our points using a <strong>Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)</strong>. KDE is a statistical technique to generate a smooth continuous distribution between data points that represent the density of the underlying pattern.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>A KDE will produce a raster surface that details the estimated distribution of our event point data over space. Each cell within our raster contains a value that is this estimated density at that location; when visualised in its entirety as the whole raster, we can quickly identify areas of high and low density, i.e.&nbsp;where are clusters are located in our dataset. To create this surface, a KDE computes a localised density for small subsets of our study area but unlike quadrat analysis, these subsets overlap one another to create a <em>moving</em> sub-region window, defined by a <strong>kernel</strong>. A kernel defines the shape and size of the window and can also weight the points, using a defined kernel function. The simplest kernel function is a basic kernel where each point in the kernel window is assigned equal weight. The kernel density approach generates a grid of density values whose cell size is smaller than that of the kernel window. Each cell is assigned the density value computed for the kernel window centered on that cell. The resulting surface is created from these individually, locally calculated density values.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Producing a KDE in R is very straight-forward in <code>spatstat</code>, using your <code>ppp</code> object and the <code>density.ppp()</code> function. However, you will need to consider both the <strong>bandwidth</strong> or diameter of your Kernel (<code>sigma</code>) and whether you want to apply a weighting to your points using a function. First, let’s go ahead and create a simple KDE of bike theft with our bandwidth set to 100m:</p>

<p>Our clusters now appear brighter and larger than our KDE with a 100m bandwidth. This is because changing the bandwidth enables your KDE to take into account more points within its calculation, resulting in a smoother surface. However, there are issues with oversmoothing your data - as you can see above, our clusters are not as well defined and therefore we may attribute high levels of bike theft to areas where there actually is not that much. Smaller bandwidths will lead to a more irregular shaped surface, where we have more precision in our defined clusters but, once again, there are issues of undersmoothing.</p>

</div>
<p>Although bandwidth typically has a more pronounced effect upon the density estimation than the type of kernel used, kernel types can affect the result too. When we use a different kernel type, we are looking to weight the points within our kernel differently:</p>

<p>Each function will result in [a slightly different estimation. Deciding which function is most suitable for your analysis will all depend on what you are trying to capture.

<p>We can be quite confident in stating that bike theft in London in 2021 is not a spatially random process and we can clearly see the areas where bicycle theft is most concentrated. How can we use this new data in our original analysis that looks to find out whether bike theft primarily occurs near tube and train stations? KDEs are primarily used for visual analysis of point data distribution. What we can do, however, is improve our visualisation and making it into a proper map using <code>tmap</code>.</p>

<p>We now have a standalone raster we can use with any function in the <code>tmap</code> library. Before we go ahead, one issue we will face is that our resulting raster does not have a Coordinate Reference System, so we need to manually add this information to the raster object:</p>

<p>We have spent a good amount of time looking at using density-based methods to quantify whether our point data is randomly distributed and visualise and identify high and low areas of density, showing if our data is clustered and where. <strong>Distance-based</strong> methods, on the other hands, allow us to quantify the second order properties of our data, i.e.&nbsp;the influence the location of these points have on one another.</p>

<p>Distance-based measures analyse the spatial distribution of points using distances between point pairs, with the majority using Euclidean distance, to determine quantitatively whether our data is, again, randomly distributed or shows sign of clustering or dispersion. These methods are a more rigorous alternative to using the Quadrat Analysis approach, and enables us to assess clustering within our point data at both a global and local scale. For the remainder of this practical, we look at one distance-based measure (<strong>average nearest neighbour</strong>) as well as a well-known hybrid technique (<strong>DBSCAN</strong>)</p>

<p>Average Nearest Neighbour (ANN) is the average distance between all points within a dataset and their individual nearest point. ANN is used as a global indicator to measure the overall pattern of a point set. The ANN of a given point collection can be compared with the expected ANN from points following a random distribution to test whether our point data is clustered or dispersed. The approach is similar to that of the Quadrat Analysis simulation we saw above, but by using distance rather than density grouped to arbitrary quadrats, ANN is likely to be a more robust quantification of our point distribution.</p>
<p>We can calculate the ANN for our dataset by using the <code>nndist()</code> function from the <code>spatstat</code> library:</p>

<p>We can see that the average nearest neighbour for all points is 53.5 metres. To get an insight into the spatial ordering of all our points relative to one another we can plot the ANN values for different order neighbours (i.e.&nbsp;first closest point, second closest point, etc. For point patterns that are highly clustered, we would expect the average distances between points to be very small.</p>

<p>The techniques above are useful exploratory techniques for telling us if we have spatial clusters present in our point data, but they are not able to tell us precisely <em>where</em> in our area of interest the clusters are occurring. One popular technique for discovering precise clusters in space is an algorithm known as <strong>DBSCAN</strong>, an algorithm that incorporates both distance and density.</p>

<p>For the complete overview of the DBSCAN algorithm, you can refer to the original paper by <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf">Ester <em>et al</em>. (1996)</a>. Whilst DBSCAN is a relatively old algorithm, there has been a substantial <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3068335">resurgence</a> in its use within spatial data science (e.g.&nbsp;see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2019.103217">Arribas-Bel <em>et al.</em> 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>We can use DBSCAN to detect clusters within our bike theft dataset and then use the clusters to further answer our original research question. DBSCAN takes two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum number of points: <code>MinPts</code>.</li>
<li>The distance: <code>epsilon</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Across a set of points, DBSCAN will group together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement and a minimum number of points. It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions. The algorithm can be used to find associations and structures in data that are hard to find through visual observation alone, but that can be relevant and useful to find patterns and predict trends. However, DBSCAN will only work well if you are able to successfully define the distance and minimum points parameters and your clusters do not vary considerably in density.</p>

<p>The DBSCAN output contains three objects, including a vector detailing the cluster for each of our bike theft observations. To be able to work with our DBSCAN output effectively and, for example, plot the clusters as individual polygons, we need to add our cluster groups back to into our original point dataset. Because the DBSCAN output does not change the order of points, we can simply stick the cluster output on the <code>bike_theft_london</code> spatial dataframe.</p>

<p>Now we have each of our bike theft points in London associated with a specific cluster, we can generate a polygon that represents these clusters in space, as we can sort of see in our above plot. To do so, we will utilise a geometric operation from the <code>sf</code> package: the <code>st_convex_hull()</code> function. The <code>st_convex_hull()</code> function can be used to create a polygon that represents the minimum coverage of our individual clusters. We can use this function to create a polygon that represents the geometry of all points within each cluster. To enable this, we will use something called a <code>for</code> loop. A <code>for</code> loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times.</p>

<li>Calculate the convex hull of that single set of geometry observations.</li>

<p>We have conducted a lot of analysis today. What we have failed to do, however, is to make proper maps. For this week’s assignment, create two publishable maps with all the trimmings using the main outputs from today’s tutorial:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A Kernel Density Map of bike theft in London.</li>
<li>A cluster map of bike theft in London, using the DBSCAN output.</li>

<p>Last week you might have had a look at the book <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores-v3/index.html">Data Skills for Reproducible Research</a>. A great tool that can be used to create reproducible workflos is found in the <code>targets</code> package. The targets package is a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>-like pipeline tool for Statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. To get started: have a look at the <a href="https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> chapter to see <code>targets</code> in action.</p>

<p>As geographers we are keen to understand our point data’s distribution and understand whether are our points clustered, randomly distributed, uniform or dispersed. We have looked at various techniques that enable us to statistically and visually assess our data’s distribution and understand whether our data is randomly distributed or clustered in space. And that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zxtbwGogyY">us done for this week</a>. Reading list anyone?</p>
